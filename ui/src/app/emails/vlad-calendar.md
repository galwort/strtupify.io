Hello End User,

This is Vlad from IT Support at startupify.io. I was told that your business would require meetings, so I've enabled the calendar on your system. In the future, this information should have been communicated to IT ahead of time...

The calendar shows you your meetings for the following week. I've added the ability to rescedule meetings, you just drag the meeting to the new time slot. This was a highly requested feature from other end users. Please submit any reschedule requests ahead of time before the week is over. Doing things ahead of time is best practice. I wanted to remind you of this...

You will not be able to reschedule other employee's meetings that you are not involved in. This was a confusing issue for end users. It is best practice to respect other peoples time...

I've added in a scoring system that is dependent on how much uninterrupted focus time you are able to accumulate for that week. Must be nice to have such time...

I am working on a very advanced feature to cancel meetings, so I will be very busy and may not be able to immediately respond to all of your emails...

Thank you!
Vlad
