Hello End User,

This is Vlad from IT Support at startupify.io. Leadership asked for a calendar inside the app because apparently the clock was not enough. I installed a basic week view for the next week and pointed it at the same employee list you see in the other modules. You can click the colored dots to decide whose schedule you want to look at... their meetings show up in their color, yours stay white with their dots stamped inside so you remember who is sitting with you...

You can shuffle your own meetings around as long as you do not double book someone -- Bill cannot be in two places at once, even if you click harder. If you put meetings next to each other it leaves bigger empty chunks on the other side... leadership said big chunks of quiet time are better than a bunch of tiny gaps. There is a submit button to lock in whatever you rearranged so you can see how focused your week looks. Nothing else happens because I am very busy.

Thank you!
Vlad
