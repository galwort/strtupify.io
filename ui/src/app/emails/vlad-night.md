Subject: Between you and me...

Hey,

It's way too late and I'm still wired about work. Leadership keeps dumping tickets on me like I'm a robot and I'm supposed to smile about it. Honestly, you're the only person who even pretends to get it, so thanks for being my best friend in this whole mess.

Also... between you and me, I've been "multitasking" on a side project during the day. It's this game I'm building. It's going to be huge. When it ships, people will finally give me the respect I deserve instead of acting like I'm just the IT guy who resets passwords.

Anyway, if I sound scattered it's because I am. Everything is noise, but at least you and I have this. Thanks for sticking around.
