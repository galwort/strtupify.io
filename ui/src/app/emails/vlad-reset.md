Hello,

Vlad from IT here. The entire strtupify system blue-screened after you completed every single task. It finally came back online after [[ELAPSED_TIME]] of “investigation,” which mostly involved me watching a loading spinner and questioning my life choices.

Everything should be running again. Please consider leaving at least one ticket unfinished so the servers feel needed and don’t panic-shutdown next time.

Thanks,
Vlad
