Hello End User,

This is Vlad from IT Support at startupify.io. You may have noticed a new icon appear on your sidebar. We've had complaint from users who weren't sure what to do with the new icon (Kevin). You can click it...

This will take you to the kanban component, where you can drag tasks into the doing column for your employees to start working on them. Let me know if you somehow have issues with that...

Thank you!
